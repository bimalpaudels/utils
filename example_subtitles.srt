1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Dad: I told my wife she was drawing
her eyebrows too high.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Dad: She looked surprised.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Son: Dad, can you put my shoes on?

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Dad: No, I don't think they'll fit me.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Son: I'm hungry.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Dad: Hi Hungry, I'm Dad.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Son: Dad, did you get a haircut?

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Dad: No, I got them all cut.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Mom: Why don't you ever help
with the housework?

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Dad: I do help. I make it
more challenging for you.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Son: What's the best thing about
Switzerland?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Dad: I don't know, but the flag
is a big plus.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Daughter: Dad, I'm cold.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Dad: Go stand in the corner.
It's 90 degrees.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Son: Can you make me a sandwich?

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Dad: Poof! You're a sandwich.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Mom: Did you fix the dishwasher?

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,000
Dad: I didn't know it was broken.
It's been washing dishes fine.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Mom: No, the machine.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Dad: Oh. Still no.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Daughter: Why can't you be
like a normal dad?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Dad: I used to be normal.
Then I had kids.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Son: What do you call a bear
with no teeth?

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Dad: A gummy bear. I taught you that.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,500
Son: Oh right. You tell it
at every party.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Dad: That's because it's a good joke.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,500
Mom: We haven't been to a party
in three years.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
Dad: Exactly. My joke success rate
is 100 percent.

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Daughter: That's not how statistics work.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,000
Dad: 73% of statistics are
made up on the spot.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Son: Including that one?

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,000
Dad: Especially that one.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Mom: I'm going to bed. Can you
lock up tonight?

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,500
Dad: Sure. Which kid should
I lock up first?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Mom: The house, dear. Lock up the house.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Dad: Oh. That makes more sense.

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,000
