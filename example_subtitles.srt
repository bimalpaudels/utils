00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Here, in the wild digital plains of Silicon Valley,
we observe a curious creature.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,000
The Developer. Notice how it sits,
bathed in the glow of multiple monitors.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Today, it has discovered something remarkable:
a task management application.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
"I could build this myself," it whispers,
eyes gleaming with ambition.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Watch as it opens a new repository.
The ritual has begun.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Day One: Our developer creates the perfect folder structure.
Truly magnificent.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Day Two: It debates between React and Vue
for the next three hours.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Finally, a decision is made.
The scaffolding is complete.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Day Three: It builds a custom authentication system.
"Why use libraries?" it ponders.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Day Four: The developer discovers
another interesting application.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
"A note-taking app! I could build this too!"
The cycle begins anew.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
The task manager, now forgotten,
joins the repository graveyard.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Alongside it: a Slack clone, a Trello replica,
and three different weather apps.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
But wait! What's this?
Our developer spots a new framework.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
"Everything I've built is obsolete now,"
it declares with certainty.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,500
And so, the note-taking app joins its siblings,
half-formed and abandoned.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Developer's GitHub profile now boasts
47 repositories.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Each one, a testament to enthusiasm.
None of them, actually finished.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yet our developer remains undeterred,
forever optimistic.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
For in this vast digital ecosystem,
there is always another project to start.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And perhaps, just perhaps,
this next one will be different.

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Narrator: It won't be.
But let us not disturb this beautiful delusion.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Nature, in all its wisdom,
has created the perfect loop.

24
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
The Developer has already opened a new terminal.
The hunt for the next idea begins.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And so, the circle of software life continues.
